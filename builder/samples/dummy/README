This sample demonstrates how to build a inference pipeline with a dummy backend. The experiment is mainly for testing the basic flow.

The sample configuration supports multiple input types including image data, image assets and video assets in one endpoint

Build the dummy inference flow:

cd builder
python main.py samples/dummy/dummy.yaml -a samples/dummy/openapi.yaml -c samples/dummy/processors.py -o samples/dummy  --server-type fastapi -t

Run the dummy inference flow:

cd samples
docker compose up --build dry-run

Test the dummy inference flow:
