This sample demonstrates how to build a deepstream application:

Model files are loaded from '/workspace/models/{MODEL_NAME}' with the container, thus the volume must be correctly mapped from the host. For example:
If you have a model under '$HOME/models/resnet50', you must map '$HOME/models' to '/workspace/models' and set MODEL_NAME to 'resnet50' when starting the container.

python builder/main.py builder/samples/ds_app/ds_app.yaml -a builder/samples/tao/openapi.yaml -o builder/samples/ds_app -t

Run the deepstream app with a container:

cd samples
docker compose up --build ds-app

Submit an inference request:

curl -X 'POST' \
  'http://localhost:8800/v1/inference' \
  -H 'accept: application/x-ndjson' \
  -H 'Content-Type: application/json' \
  -d '{
  "input": [{
    "path": "/opt/nvidia/deepstream/deepstream/samples/streams/sample_1080p_h264.mp4",
    "contentType": "video/mp4"
  }],
  "model": "nvidia/nvdino-v2"
}' -N
